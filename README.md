# Error Analysis in C#

We currently spend around 20-30 minutes per data file performing Excel formulas by hand to check for a long list of potential errors.
This program is capable of performing the same work using LINQ in under five seconds for 22.5 million data points. More data will take longer.

Please excuse my directory names, as this program is still in beta testing mode. So far it is working as expected.

Thank you,
